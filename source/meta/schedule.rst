Clan Schedule
=============

Note that this is pretty loose and will vary from week-to-week, depending on schedules and interest.. See ``#upcoming-events`` in Discord.

**Tuesday**: Gambit, probably

**Saturday**: New raid or raid of choice

**Sunday**: Rotator raid

We are also often doing nightfalls, grand masters, and other activities; join the ``@PVE-LFG`` role to be notified of when someone's looking to do something.
