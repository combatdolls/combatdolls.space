DRAFT: Red Border Sources
=========================

* Legendary Dares of Eternity (guarenteed one per run)
* Xur's Treassure Horde chest (chance)
* Raids (might be guarenteed)
* Seasonal Vendor (generally guarenteed one per week, plus chance per engram)
* Some Neomuna activities (low chance)
* Some Throne World activities (low chance)
* Exotic Mission rotator (guarenteed?)

Note that vendors with static rolls (eg exotic weekend Xur) cannot drop red borders.
