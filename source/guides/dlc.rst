========================
DLCs & Purchased Add-Ons
========================

While Destiny 2 is technically free-to-play, a large amount of content is part
of paid expansions.

This guide attempts to enumerate what content is gated behind what paid items.

Free
====

Most non-story activities are available for free, and technically a player
could make it all the way to end game with nothing but the free game.

Included activities are:

* The new light experience (introductory quest from Shaw Han)
* Ritual Activities: Vanguard Ops (strikes), Gambit, and Crucible
* All patrol zones
* Special Events (Solstice, Dawning, Festival of the Lost)
* Crota's End raid
* King's Fall raid
* Vault of Glass raid
* Prophecy dungeon
* Seasonal upper track rewards
* Seasonal artifact

Note that the first few missions of the campaign stories are available for free,
but the complete questline is only available if your purchase the appropriate
expansion.

Forsaken
========

While the Reef and the Forsaken story have been vaulted, there is
some content this unlocks.

* The Shattered Throne dungeon
* Last Wish raid

Shadowkeep
==========

The Shadowkeep campaign involved Eris Morn, the Moon, and a pyramid ship.

* Shadowkeep campaign story
* Pit of Heresy dungeon
* Garden of Salvation raid

Beyond Light
============

Beyond Light introduced us to The Exo Stranger, Europa, and the damnable Clovis Bray.

* The Beyond Light campaign
* Stasis subclasses
* The Deep Stone Crypt raid

The Witch Queen
===============

The Witch Queen features the return of Savathun and her throne world.

* The Witch Queen campaign
* Weapon Crafting via The Artifact
* The Wellspring Activity

The Witch Queen Dungeon Key
---------------------------

Starting with Witch Queen, the dungeons were an additional add-on.

* Duality dungeon
* Spire of the Watcher dungeon
* Vow of the Disciple raid

Lightfall
=========

Lightfall features Neomuna, Neptune, and its protector Nimbus.

* The Lightfall campaign
* Root of Nightmares raid

Lightfall Dungeon Key
---------------------

* Ghosts of the Deep dungeon
* Warlords Ruin dungeon

30th Anniversary
================

The Nine have brought us a challenge! And a horse!

Look, it's a game show, and Xur is very confused.

* Dares of Eternity
* Xur's Treasure Horde
* Grasp of Avarice dungeon

Season Passes
=============

Each season has its own pass. This page will not list every season, but speak
generally.

* That season's story
* That season's activities
* Seasonal lower track rewards

Event Cards
===========

Special events have an extra event card that can be purchased. This doesn't
unlock anything, it just gives extra rewards.

Character & Skip Boosts
=======================

These just complete/upgrade secondary characters, allowing you to skip some of
the low-level content after you have finished it once. No content is unlocked.

Bundles
=======

Many of the above items are available together in bundles. These vary over time,
but common ones are:

* Annual Pass: four season passes (and maybe a raid key?)
* Expansion Deluxe Editions: The expansion and its raid key (and maybe the seasons)
* Expansion bundles: Old expansions are frequently bundled

Cross-Play
==========

Different DLC interact with cross-play in different ways. In general:

* Full expansions (eg Lightfall) must be purchased per-platform
* Season passes are shared across platforms
