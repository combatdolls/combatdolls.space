Combat Dolls is a queer-focused and PVE-focused Destiny clan.
We pride ourselves on getting new players interested in high level content
prepared and into our regular raid teams.

We're open to all skill levels and will happily infodump about the mechanics of
Destiny and encourage our members to always push to more challenging content.

Before joining, please be aware we have and enforce a :doc:`meta/coc`.

You don't need to be queer to join.

You don't need to be an exo; we can help with that.
